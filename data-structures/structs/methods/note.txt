(p person) is the receiver
it's another parameter
it's not idiomatic to use "this" or "self"

"Not many people know this, but method notation, i.e. v.Method() is actually syntatic sugar and Go also understands the de-sugared version of it:
(T).Method(v). You can see an example here. Naming the receiver like any other parameter reflects that it is, in fact, just another parameter quite well

This also implies that the receiver-argument inside a method may be nil. This is not the cas with this in e.g. Java.
