user defined types - we declare a new type, foo
the underlying type of foo is int

conversion: int(myAge)
converting type foo to type int

This code is only for example
It's a BAD PRACTICE to alias types

One exception: if you need to attach methods to a type
see the time package for an example of This
    godoc.org/time
    type Duration int64

Duration has methods attached to it
